Predictive Model on House Price
This is a predictive model constructed on the house data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data).
If interested, read the pdf report and any comments, suggestions, and questions are welcomed.

The regression methods and other machine learning techniques(or statistical) discussed are: 
1. KNN imputation 
2. multiple linear regression
3. Variable selection
4. Regularization
5. Nonlinearity test
6. Random Forest
7. Interaction

Some future works planned at the moment are:
1. Automation of adding variables with test RMSE ( extension of variable selection)
2. Boostrapping to increase the sample size
3. Cross validations
4. Dimension Reduction via PCA & Autoencoder
